Yep, another CLI, use this to learn english

Not done yet, there's no complete function ... 

## Function
+ Find new words in text and look up that word. (input can be text (directly through flag), youtube-video's URL, .txt file path, pdf(just kidding I'm not that good ...))
+ Save those new words just look up for later use.
